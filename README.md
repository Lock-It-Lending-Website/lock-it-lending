# Lockit Lending Website (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

Welcome to the Lockit Lending website repo! This is a modern rebuild of the original WordPress site, using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

This guide is written to help anyone ‚Äî even without coding experience ‚Äî get started, run, and update the project step-by-step.

---

## What This Project Does

This website is a replica (and soon improvement!) of [https://lockitlending.com](https://lockitlending.com). It includes:

- A beautiful homepage with sections (Hero, Purchase, Refinance, etc.)
- A sticky header with navigation
- A responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Footer with links and contact info

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: Safer JavaScript with types
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (utility-first)
- **Create React App**: How the project was originally bootstrapped
- **GitHub Pages**: For live deployment

> üí° When adding a **new page**, always place the file inside the `src/pages/` folder, and then link to it via the router in `App.tsx`.

## How To Run This Locally

### Step 1: Install the tools

1. Install [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. (Optional) Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Step 2: Open the project

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open the folder in VS Code (or any editor)

### Step 3: Install the dependencies

In the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install everything the website needs (React, Tailwind, etc.)

### Step 4: Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser ‚Äî you should see the site!

---

## How To Update Content

### Change images:

Put your new images in the `public/` folder, then reference them like:

```tsx
<img src="/new-image.png" alt="something" />
```

### Change text:

Go into the file inside `src/pages/` or `src/components/` and change the text like editing a document.

### Add new sections:

Add a new `<section>` in `Home.tsx` or other page and style it with Tailwind.

---

## Known Issues / TODOs

- ‚úÖ Tailwind is working now
- ‚úÖ Routes go to the correct pages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Footer needs better styling to match the official site
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Form logic is not yet implemented (e.g. rates submission)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scroll animations / scrollspy not fully added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image optimization (some logos weren‚Äôt loading)

---

## Features Still To Add

Here‚Äôs what we still want to build:

- [ ] Responsive mobile nav menu (hamburger style)
- [ ] Better footer layout w/ categories (Products, Contact, Legal, etc.)
- [ ] Modular section components (Review.tsx, Refinement.tsx, etc.)
- [ ] ScrollSpy to highlight nav as you scroll
- [ ] Load reviews dynamically

---

## Contribution Guide

- Use `src/pages/` for pages
- Use `src/components/` for UI building blocks
- No need to learn React in depth ‚Äî just copy/paste and edit text/images to help

---

## Code Quality Setup

We use **ESLint (Flat Config)** + **Prettier** to maintain clean, consistent code across the project, along with type checking and tests to prevent bugs.

---

### Scripts Overview

| Command                | Description                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run lint`         | Lints the code for style & best practices |
| `npm run type-check`   | Runs TypeScript type checks               |
| `npm test`             | Runs all unit tests                       |
| `npm run format`       | Formats the code using Prettier           |
| `npm run format:check` | Checks if formatting is correct           |

---

### Lint the Code

```bash
npm run lint
```

Checks for:

- Code style (spacing, quotes, semicolons, trailing spaces, etc.)
- React/JSX errors
- TypeScript ESLint rules
- Console logs and debuggers

---

### Type-Check the Code

```bash
npm run type-check
```

Uses TypeScript to catch type-related bugs without compiling the code.

---

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Executes all unit tests with `react-scripts test`.

---

### Format Your Code with Prettier

```bash
npm run format
```

Auto-formats all project files based on our Prettier rules.

To check if files are already formatted (without modifying them):

```bash
npm run format:check
```

---

## Before You Push Code

Always run:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run format
```

To auto-fix most style issues:

```bash
npx eslint 'src/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}' --fix
npm run format
```
