                <strong>The Texas Hill Country flood </strong> which struck{' '}
                <strong> Kerrville over the 4th of July weekend </strong> brought heartbreak to
                families across the region. At <strong> Lock it Lending </strong>, this tragedy hit
                especially close to home. Our team heard the news through a personal connection. My
                daughter Natalie told me one of the girls affected was the little sister of her
                soccer teammate. For the past two summers, both of our kids, Ty and Natalie,
                attended a beloved <strong> Texas summer camp near Kerrville </strong>. I remember
                watching the camp’s photo app like a hawk, spotting them kayak, swimming, dancing,
                and making lifelong friends. Every pickup day was filled with joy, hugs, and “I
                don’t want to go home” smiles on their sun-kissed faces. That’s why this loss is so
                deeply personal. Parents send their kids to camp to experience joy, growth, and
                connection, not tragedy. The pain these families are experiencing is unimaginable.

                On <strong> July 6, 2025 </strong>, a <strong> Texas Day of Prayer </strong>was
                observed across the state to honor flood victims and uplift the families, first
                responders, and volunteers. It was a powerful moment of statewide and national
                solidarity. One grieving family’s words reminded us of the strength found even in
                sorrow:

                Country, and we were devastated to learn that our precious was among the victims…
                While we know that her joy is now eternal and her faith has become sight, our hearts
                are shattered by this loss… We thank you for your prayers and support.”

                Just days after the <strong> Kerrville flood </strong>, residents shared images of
                long lines of <strong> H-E-B trucks </strong> heading to the disaster zone. It was a
                powerful symbol of Texas businesses and communities rallying together. At{' '}
                <strong> Lock It Lending </strong>, we felt called to help however we could. One of
                our own, <strong> Loan Officer Travis Spencer </strong>, is currently on the ground
                in Kerrville. He has been working 14 to 16 hour days to support cleanup and recovery
                efforts. His passion for service goes beyond the mortgage industry. Travis leads a
                nonprofit organization, <strong> SteeleCroft </strong>, a registered{' '}
                <strong> 501(c)(3) </strong>focused on disaster relief and community rebuilding. To
                support Travis and the Kerrville community, Lock It Lending has donated{' '}
                <strong> $3,000 </strong>to <strong> SteeleCroft’s flood relief mission. </strong>
                This is just a small step in the much larger effort to help families rebuild their
                lives. If you’d like to contribute, donations can be made{' '}
