<h2>The Swift Home Loans Inc. family</h2>
<p>The Swift Home Loans Inc. family referred to as (the Company) is dedicated to treating our clients like they are right next door for their home financing process. A big part of that is based upon prompt and convenient communication with our clients, vendors and others. For that reason, we offer various means of communication including Email, fax, telephone, Facebook messenger, Get Response, express mail, voice mail, etc. To demonstrate our commitment to prompt and convenient communications, we have adopted the following terms and conditions, regarding Email, which are incorporated by reference into all Emails sent and received by our Team Members (i.e., our employees). Our communications with you via Email are conditioned upon your agreement to the following terms:</p>

<h2>Email In General</h2>
<p>Email is an effective means of communicating a message. However, due to its brief and informal nature, Email may not accurately represent the entire or final disposition of a matter or the official business records of the Company. In most instances, communications on a particular matter are exchanged through multiple channels such as through Emails, faxes, voicemails, letters, IM, telephone, and in person. Indeed, communications on a particular matter may be exchanged through multiple channels, all at the same time, such as when an Email responds to a voicemail, a fax follows-up a personal meeting, a voicemail responds to an Email, etc. Accordingly, Email, by itself, may not accurately reflect the complete communication or intent of the Company as to the subject matter referred to within the communication, nor constitute an official business record of the Company. All official matters should be subsequently confirmed in signed writings. Also, the mere receipt of an Email by the Company may not put the Company on notice, timely or otherwise, of the matters contained within that Email.</p>

<h2>Confidential Information</h2>
<p>Emails sent by our Team Members are confidential (and all attachments to such Emails are confidential) and are to be reviewed and/or disclosed to only the individual or entity to whom they are addressed and intended. If you received an Email in error or if it was improperly forwarded to you, the information contained in the Email should, at all times, remain confidential and such circumstances shall not authorize you to use or disclose the confidential information. Please notify the sender immediately by telephone or Email, and delete or destroy the original and any copies. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, reproduction, or distribution is strictly prohibited. Emails marked as “Confidential” contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is disclosed under the condition that you treat and maintain such information strictly in a confidential manner and in compliance with applicable privacy laws (including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and that you ensure such information is not disclosed or used by others, except for the limited and confidential purpose for which it is being provided. By accepting and reviewing Confidential information provided by the Company, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, or expenses, including attorney’s fees that the Company may incur as a result of the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information due to your acts or omissions.</p>

<h2>Emails are generally not formal signed writings: E-Sign Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Unless there is explicit and specific language and disclosures to the contrary, Emails from our Company do not contain or constitute an electronic signature, even if the sender’s name appears in the Email. Email communications are not intended to be construed against the Company as an interest rate lock, an unconditional loan commitment, an unconditional loan approval, unconditional qualification, or any unconditional offer or agreement to lend. Such documents and agreements are generally sent to clients in formal signed writings from the Company.</p>

<h2>Privileged Information</h2>
<p>Emails exchanged with or involving our Legal Team may contain privileged information subject to the attorney client privilege and/or the attorney work product privilege. Such privileged information shall not be waived if you receive an Email in error or if it was improperly forwarded to you. If you are not the intended recipient of privileged information, please notify the sender immediately by telephone or Email and delete or destroy the original and any copies. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, reproduction, or distribution of confidential or privileged information is strictly prohibited.</p>

<h2>Time Sensitive Instructions and Official Matters</h2>
<p>Do not use Email to communicate time-sensitive instructions or official company matters; they may not be received or reviewed by the appropriate Team Member in a timely manner. All Emails are processed through various virus and spam filters which may delay or reject the delivery of an Email altogether. Urgent matters should be communicated in person directly with the person of concern via telephone and then confirmed in writing with the appropriate person via fax or Email. The Company reserves the right to block any Email source it deems inappropriate.</p>

<h2>Business Purposes</h2>
<p>The Company’s Email facilities are to be used only for conducting business with our Company. Vendors, suppliers, clients and others receiving Email from our Team Members may not use our Team Member’s Email address or contact information (or any other person’s Email address appearing on or in Company Email) for any purpose other than corresponding with our Company for lawful and legitimate business purposes relating to the business of our Company. The receipt of an Email is not our Company’s consent, nor our Team Member’s consent, for you to use our Team Member’s Email address or contact information for direct marketing purposes or for transfers of data to third-parties, and such use is strictly prohibited.</p>

<h2>Monitoring of Communications</h2>
<p>All Emails sent to or from our Team Members may be forwarded, monitored, and/or reviewed by others within our Company other than the designated recipient/sender with or without notice to the designated recipient/sender. We may also record or monitor other forms of communications you have with us via the website, PC-talk, messenger, Email, and telephone. By using such communications methods you are consenting to:</p>

<h2>Unsecured Transmissions</h2>
<p>You should be aware that regular Email is typically sent via the Internet which is an open network. While certain designated areas within our websites employ technologies to secure your data and the transmissions between you and our Company, general Email uses the Internet which is an open system and we cannot provide absolute assurances that all Email transmissions (sent or received) are secure, error free, not corrupted, incomplete or virus free and/or that they won’t be lost, misdelivered, destroyed, delayed, or intercepted/decrypted by others. Therefore the Company advises against sending sensitive or personally identifiable information, over Email, and disclaims all liability with regard to Emails (and the contents therein) if they are corrupted, lost, destroyed, delayed, incomplete, misdelivered, intercepted, decrypted or otherwise misappropriated by others.</p>

<h2>Viruses</h2>
<p>Computer viruses can be transmitted via Email through Email content, attachments to Emails and embedded links. Although our Emails are believed to be free of any virus or other defects that might affect computer systems in which they are received and opened, it is the recipient’s responsibility to ensure that any Email they open is virus free. The Company is not responsible for any loss or damage arising in any way from the receipt, use, storage or transmission of our Emails. If our Company forwards an Email or replies to a prior Email, the contents may have been produced by someone other than our Company or our Team Members for which the Company assumes no liability whatsoever. THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT COMPANY EMAILS ARE VIRUS FREE AND/OR ERROR FREE. The use of Email to introduce any virus, malicious or disabling code, or to otherwise interfere with the Company’s Email transmissions, telecommunication, or computer networks is prohibited and against the law; violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

<h2>Prohibited Email Content</h2>
